---------------------

A personal name isn't that easy with only one given name concat with one surname.

Common componets of names include:

* Personal name
* Patronymic
* Matronymic
* Family name

For example, Romanian name usually consists of a given name and a surname. But
in offcial documents, surnames usually appear before given names. In Spanish naming,
it consists of a given name followed by two family names. Eastern Slavic naming
usually consists of a given name, patronymic and family name. In Taiwan, the family
name will concat wiht given name, and usually with one (family name) and two (given name) words.
